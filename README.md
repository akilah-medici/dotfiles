This repository is meant to store and share my dotfiles from Arch Linux customization on Hyprland. Here you'll find configuration files and customizations for a modern Linux desktop environment.

## About

This collection contains my personal dotfiles for:
- **Arch Linux** - A lightweight and flexible Linux distribution
